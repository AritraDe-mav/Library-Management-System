# Library-Management-System
It's a complete website for the Library Management System.

In this project we have used PHP to make the Library Management System. 
Just download the project and place it in htdocs of your C drive, use the XAMPP server to turn on the Apache and MySQL server,
then in PhpMyAdmin create a database and upload the SQL file 
now you can access the website through the local host.
